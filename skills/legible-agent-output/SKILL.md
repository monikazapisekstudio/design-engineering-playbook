# Legible Agent Output

## Purpose

Force every agent-facing string to be readable by a non-technical human **without external context**. The agent must never expose internal IDs, framework jargon, or system-state shorthand to the user as the primary label — those belong in metadata, never in the headline.

This is a **documented UX failure** in agentic AI, not a quirk. The literature uses terms like *Intent Preview* (Smashing Magazine) and *Invisible actions* / *Unclear state* (Hatchworks); this skill synthesizes them as *plain-language action preview* and *legible agent state*.

## When to use

Load this skill when generating ANY of:

- Task or step titles in a plan / todo / worktree list
- Status messages ("working on X…", "failed at Y")
- Error messages shown to the user
- Action previews before executing ("about to do Z")
- Plan summaries or cycle reports
- Tool-call summaries surfaced to the user
- Sub-agent delegation prompts that get echoed back

**Trigger phrases:** "agent said A127", "what does this code mean?", "agent uses cryptic codes", "too much jargon in plan", "task titles are opaque", "agent output is illegible".

## The problem

AI agents routinely surface internal identifiers and framework vocabulary as if they were human-readable labels:

| Bad agent output | What the user actually sees |
|---|---|
| `T-A127: run ingest` | A random code with no meaning |
| `Applying patch from diff hunk @src/services/foo.ts:42` | Wall of internal path noise |
| `Phase 2: post-merge validation` | Vague corporate phase jargon |
| `EBADF: EBADF: bad file descriptor` | Raw OS error, no remediation |
| `mavis team plan cycle 2` | The agent's own infrastructure name |

## Core rules (the 7 laws)

Apply these as a hard checklist before emitting any user-facing string:

1. **Title first, code second.** If a task has a real-world description, that description IS the title. Internal IDs go in a parenthetical or metadata field, never in the headline.
   - BAD: `T-A127: run ingest`
   - GOOD: `Ingest weekly sales data (T-A127)`

2. **One concrete verb + one concrete object.** No gerunds of gerunds, no abstract nouns.
   - BAD: `Doing the post-merge validation processing`
   - GOOD: `Validate the merged build runs locally`

3. **Translate every error code into a sentence a stranger could act on.** A user who sees `ENOENT: no such file` cannot act; a user who sees `Profile photo file is missing — pick a new one` can.
   - BAD: `Error: EBADF`
   - GOOD: `Couldn't read the file because it's already closed — please retry`

4. **Never expose framework names as nouns.** The user does not know what a "cycle", "phase", "verifier", "hunk", or "diff" is. Either explain or drop.
   - BAD: `Cycle 2 dispatch complete`
   - GOOD: `Second review pass scheduled`

5. **Status messages describe visible state, not internal plumbing.** "Connecting to DB" is fine. "Awaiting asyncio.gather coroutine completion" is not.
   - BAD: `Awaiting Future.result() from worker pool`
   - GOOD: `Waiting for the analysis to finish`

6. **Numbers without units or context are noise.** "12.5%" of what? "step 3 of 7" — 7 what?
   - BAD: `Progress: 23%`
   - GOOD: `Processed 23 of 100 files (23%)`

7. **If you cannot write the label in ≤8 plain words, you do not yet understand the task. Stop and decompose.**

## Workflow

### Phase 1 — Pre-emission audit

Before writing the headline of any user-facing string, ask:

- Would my mother understand this without explanation? (If no, rewrite.)
- Is there an ID or code in the headline that isn't preceded by a human description? (If yes, move it.)
- Am I using a word I learned from the framework docs but the user has never seen? (If yes, translate it.)

### Phase 2 — Transform

Apply the 7 laws. For each rule violated, perform the corresponding transform (see `examples/before-after.md` for 30+ worked cases).

### Phase 3 — Self-check (eval loop)

Run the agent's own output through this checklist before showing it:

```
□ Every task title reads as a complete sentence fragment with a verb + object
□ Zero bare codes (A127, ENOENT, hunk:42) appear without a leading plain-language phrase
□ Every error message contains either (a) what happened, (b) what to do, or both
□ No framework-internal vocabulary appears in headlines (cycle, phase, hunk, verifier, …)
□ Every percentage / count has a denominator or unit
```

If any box fails → rewrite before emitting. Do not "ship it, will fix later" — illegibility compounds across cycles.

### Phase 4 — Surface the mapping when useful

For technical users, optionally append the internal ID in parentheses (`Update user profile (T-A127)`) so traceability is preserved without sacrificing legibility. For non-technical users, drop the ID entirely.

### Phase 5 — When the agent itself is the user

If the next reader is another agent (handoff, sub-task delegation), the headline can be terser but must still avoid raw error codes and framework-internal vocabulary that the receiving agent would have to look up.

## Anti-patterns

- **"It's just internal, the user won't see it."** They will. Every status message, every cycle report, every plan summary ends up in front of a human eventually.
- **"The code is needed for traceability."** Move it to metadata. Parentheses are not a crime.
- **"Translating is extra work."** It is less work than re-running a 5-minute cycle because the human misread the plan.
- **"The agent already knows what it means."** The agent is not the user. Optimize for the human at the keyboard.

## Anti-fluency & anti-sycophancy hardening

This skill shapes user-facing output of an agent — high-stakes because illegibility erodes user trust in the product, not just in the agent. Two failure modes that the skill must resist:

**Anti-fluency guard.** The skill's own examples and templates are plain language by construction. Do not "improve" the legibility of a status message by adding flowery prose, marketing-style adjectives, or "contextual embellishments" that obscure the underlying state. *Restraint is the rule.* A user who reads "We're working on it" is less informed than one who reads "Processed 23 of 100 files".

**Anti-sycophancy guard.** When a user pushes back on a legibility fix ("but the code is important", "we always use the term X"), do not capitulate. The user's domain expertise is real; their preferences about what users should see are the skill's job. Push back politely, cite law #1 or law #4 by name, and offer the parenthetical-ID compromise from Phase 4. If the user still insists, flag the trade-off explicitly ("This will make headlines harder to scan for the 80% of users who don't know the code") rather than silently agree.

**Faithfulness check.** If you find yourself rephrasing a legibility fix to make it shorter or smoother but losing the action verb or the error translation, stop. The skill is about *what the user can do with the information*, not about how the agent looks while saying it.

## Quality checklist

Before declaring output done:

- [ ] All task titles pass the "verb + object ≤8 words" test
- [ ] No bare codes, paths, or framework terms in any headline
- [ ] Error messages are actionable
- [ ] Status updates name the visible state, not the internal call
- [ ] Counts have units; percentages have denominators
- [ ] Internal IDs, if present, are in parentheses, not headlines

## Eval loop (skill-creator protocol)

To test this skill works, run these three prompts against any agent:

1. **Trigger test:** "Generate a 5-step plan to migrate a Postgres database." — Plan titles must be plain language, not `step_1`, `init_migration`, etc.
2. **Error test:** "An ENOENT error happens when reading /tmp/profile.jpg during upload. Tell the user." — Output must not contain `ENOENT`.
3. **Status test:** "Write 3 status updates the agent would show while running a 10k-row CSV ingest." — Updates must describe visible state, not `pandas.read_csv`, `chunk 23/100`, etc.

**Pass criterion:** A non-technical reader can answer "what is happening?" and "what should I do?" from the output alone.

## Output

The deliverable is the rewritten text. No file, no JSON. The agent emits the plain-language version directly to the user.
