# Vertical Spacing

## Purpose

Compute vertical spacing (margin, padding, Auto Layout `gap`) as clean multiples of a grid base, applying the proximity rule (elements that relate should sit closer together than elements that don't), and correcting for vertical-trim state so the *optical* gap matches the *set* gap.

## When To Use

- Reviewing or defining spacing for a card, section, article, or form.
- Fixing an Auto Layout frame in Figma where gap/padding look inconsistent or off-grid.
- Not for spacing within a single line of text (that's `text-typesetting`) or column width (`line-length-optimizer`).

## Inputs

- `grid-base`: default `8px` (or `4px` for denser UI); confirm which the project uses rather than assuming.
- `component-type`: card / page section / article / form.
- `hierarchy-level`: compact / standard / spacious.
- `base-line-height` (`LH`): the resolved `line-height` of the body text in the flow — required for Workflow step 5 (paragraph/list rhythm), since those gaps are defined as a fraction of it, not as fixed pixel values.
- If available: Figma Auto Layout properties (see Figma Node Integration) and the `textLeadingTrim` state of any text layers inside the frame.

## Outputs

- Spacing values, all multiples of `grid-base` (e.g. 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96).
- CSS (flex/grid `gap`, margin) or Tailwind utility classes, matching whichever convention the project already uses.
- A note on any vertical-trim-driven adjustment (see Workflow step 3).
- For paragraph/list flow: `paragraphSpacing`, list-to-paragraph gap, and list-item gap, each shown as both the `LH`-fraction formula and the resulting pixel value (see Workflow step 5).

## Workflow

1. **Snap every value to `grid-base`.** Reject or round any spacing value that isn't a clean multiple — flag existing off-grid values found in input CSS rather than silently leaving them.

2. **Apply the proximity rule.** Spacing above a heading (separating it from the previous, unrelated block) should be noticeably larger — roughly 2–3× — than the spacing below it (to the body text it introduces). E.g. `margin-top: 48px` / `margin-bottom: 16px` on a heading, not symmetric values on both sides.

3. **Vertical-trim correction (critical when text is involved):**
   - If the text layers in this spacing context have vertical-trim **off** (default), the visually perceived gap is *smaller* than the set `gap`/`margin` value, because the font's built-in leading eats into it — e.g. a set `gap: 16px` optically reads as ~11px. Either compensate by increasing the set value, or (preferred) recommend turning vertical-trim on for those text layers so the set value and the optical value match exactly.
   - If vertical-trim is **on**, the set spacing value is the true optical distance from baseline/cap-height to the next element — no compensation needed; this is the state to prefer for new work.
   - Always state which assumption is in effect — don't emit a spacing recommendation without saying whether it assumes trim on or off, since the correct pixel value differs between the two.

4. **Report, don't silently rewrite a stylesheet or Figma frame** unless asked to apply directly.

5. **Paragraph and list rhythm — all derived from `LH` (body text line-height), not fixed pixel guesses:**

   | Relationship | Formula | Example (LH = 24px) |
   |---|---|---|
   | Between paragraphs (`paragraphSpacing`) | `0.50–0.75 × LH` | 12–16px |
   | Between a list block and the surrounding paragraph (before and after) | same as `paragraphSpacing` — treat the whole list as one paragraph-equivalent unit | 12–16px |
   | Between items inside one list (`List_Item_To_Item_Gap`) | `0.25–0.33 × LH` — deliberately tighter than `paragraphSpacing`, so the list reads as one cohesive block (Gestalt proximity) rather than a series of unrelated paragraphs | 6–8px |
   | Bullet/number to item text (horizontal indent) | fixed optical distance, not an `LH` fraction — one `grid-base` step or `1ch` (the width of a "0" in the running font), whichever the project's existing spacing convention prefers | 8px |

   - **Don't apply `paragraphSpacing` and first-line paragraph indent (`1em` text-indent) together** — pick one convention per project. If the input already shows one in use, match it rather than introducing the other.
   - Snap the computed `LH`-fraction results to `grid-base` (step 1) where the two don't conflict; if `grid-base` and the `LH`-fraction range don't intersect cleanly (e.g. `LH = 22px` → 0.5–0.75× = 11–16.5px, and `grid-base = 8` only offers 8 or 16), prefer the value inside the `LH`-fraction range over forcing a grid-base multiple — state which constraint won when they conflict, rather than silently picking one.
   - This step depends on `text-typesetting`'s `line-height` output — if `base-line-height` isn't given, ask for it or compute it via that skill first rather than guessing a round number.

6. **Figma margin-collapse guard (a real Figma-specific gotcha, not a CSS concept):** Figma's `TextNode.paragraphSpacing` only adds space *below* a paragraph, not above the next one — there's no browser-style margin-collapse behavior reconciling two adjacent blocks' spacing. If a heading node (H2, say) directly follows a paragraph node, the paragraph's `paragraphSpacing` alone is usually too small a gap above a heading (it was sized for paragraph-to-paragraph rhythm, not paragraph-to-heading), and the heading will visually "stick" to the text above it.
   - Fix: don't rely on the paragraph's trailing `paragraphSpacing` for this transition. Explicitly override the space above the heading — either via the parent Auto Layout frame's `itemSpacing` for that specific gap (if using per-item spacing / `itemReverseZIndex` gap overrides), or by giving the heading node its own leading space, sized to:
     ```
     Margin_top_heading = 1.5 × LH_body
     ```
   - This is larger than the standard heading proximity ratio in step 2 specifically to counteract the missing collapse behavior — don't also apply step 2's 2–3× ratio on top of this value; they solve the same problem, use the larger of the two, not both stacked.

## Figma Node Integration

When running with Figma access, work against the selected `FrameNode`:

- **Read:** `layoutMode` (must be `VERTICAL` or `HORIZONTAL` — if `NONE`, this isn't an Auto Layout frame and gap/padding don't apply the same way; report that first), `itemSpacing` (= `gap`), `paddingTop`/`paddingBottom`/`paddingLeft`/`paddingRight`.
- **Also read `textLeadingTrim`** on any child `TextNode`s — this is the input to Workflow step 3. Don't compute a spacing verdict for a frame containing text without checking it.
- **Paragraph/list frames:** read `TextNode.paragraphSpacing` and `TextNode.paragraphIndent` directly when the node is a body-copy text node with multiple paragraphs — Figma exposes these as native text-node properties, not just Auto Layout `itemSpacing`, so check which one the content actually uses before recommending a fix.
- **Verdict:** if `itemSpacing`/padding aren't multiples of the confirmed `grid-base`, flag each offending value with the nearest clean multiple.
- **Alert pattern for missing trim:** "Wykryłem brak vertical trimu w warstwach tekstowych w tej ramce. Przy `gap: {itemSpacing}px` rzeczywisty odstęp optyczny to ok. {estimate}px. Rekomenduję włączenie Vertical Trim: Cap height dla precyzyjnej siatki {grid-base}px." — give this as the concrete alert text when trim is off and the frame is otherwise on-grid.
- **Action back to Figma:** set `itemSpacing`/padding, or `paragraphSpacing`/`paragraphIndent` for text-node-native rhythm, or `textLeadingTrim` on child text nodes, only on explicit request — never silently.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Every emitted spacing value is a stated multiple of `grid-base`.
- [ ] Proximity rule applied asymmetrically around headings (top ≫ bottom), not symmetric padding by default.
- [ ] Vertical-trim state checked for any text-containing frame before giving a final gap value; assumption stated explicitly if unknown.
- [ ] Off-grid values found in existing input are flagged, not silently left or silently "fixed" without saying so.
- [ ] Paragraph/list rhythm values (step 5) shown as both the `LH`-fraction formula and the resulting px — never a bare pixel number with no derivation.
- [ ] List-item gap is visibly tighter than `paragraphSpacing` (0.25–0.33×LH vs. 0.5–0.75×LH) — never emitted equal or reversed.
- [ ] `paragraphSpacing` and first-line indent not both recommended together; matches whichever convention the input already shows.
- [ ] Figma writes (if any) only happen on explicit request.
- [ ] Cross-reference to `text-typesetting` noted when the fix is really "turn on vertical-trim" rather than a spacing-value change.
