# Type Scale Generator

**Generate a mathematically coherent font-size system from a base size and a ratio.**

Computes H1–H6, body, and caption sizes from a chosen ratio (musical/geometric, Fibonacci, or the historical Garamond printer's series), rounds to avoid subpixel rendering, and refuses to emit anything below the UI-legibility floor.

## What it does

- 8 named geometric ratios (Minor Second `1.067` through Golden Ratio `1.618`), each with a plain-language description of its character and best use case.
- Two non-linear historical scales: `fibonacci` (sequence-based, ties directly to a Fibonacci-proportioned layout grid) and `classic-garamond` (the renaissance-era printer's fixed type-size steps).
- Rounding guard: every computed value snaps to the nearest even integer or 4px multiple, with the raw and rounded numbers both shown.
- Readability floor: refuses to emit a token below 12px, or below 12px paired with a font-weight under 400.
- Optional fluid scale via `clamp()` for responsive sizing.
- With Figma access: checks existing text styles before writing, to avoid fragmenting an established scale.

## When to use

- Building a font-size system for a new design system or page.
- User names a ratio ("minor third", "1.25", "golden ratio") or asks for a scale with no preference stated.

## When NOT to use

- A single text style's line-height/tracking — see `text-typesetting`.
- Spacing between blocks — see `vertical-spacing`.
